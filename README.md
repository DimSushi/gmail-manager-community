This Firefox extension is a fork of [Gmail Manager NG](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gmail-manager-ng/) by Erik Nedwidek, itself forked from [Gmail Manager](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gmail-manager/) by Todd Long.
Development of those extensions appears to have stopped in February 2012 and March 2011.

**Gmail Manager-community** is available under the same licenses and is intended to be a community developed extension.
